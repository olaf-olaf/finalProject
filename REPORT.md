## DrumPad

Drumpad is a samplepad for your iphone. This app allows people to jam with classic drum sounds without hauling around heavy gear. Drumpad
consists of four drumpads that can be used to play 6 different drumkits. The way every kit sounds can be manipulated to your own liking by 
mixing every sound and adding effects.
